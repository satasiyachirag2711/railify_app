Regular maintenance is an essential part, for achieving this objective.However, maintenance is costly & it is also inevitable.And more importantly  if maintenance is not done regularly then it can result in fatal consequences, such as unexpected breakdown, delayed trip, it can even jeopardize several lives, and cost a lot of money. And we all  know that a negative impact can dilute the brand image.As a professional practice, one should emphasize maintenance rather than repair, especially in the railway industry. In simple words, to keep your equipment in good working condition, routine maintenance should be done on assets and equipment for their smooth functionality.";
