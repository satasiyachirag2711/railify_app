It is made up of complex mechanical and electrical systems.A whole new specific department would be required at various locations to keep track of the maintenance of trains, tracks, platforms, traffic light systems, etc. The equipment, assets, and inventories are also needed to be tracked, in order to perfect asset management of railways.\n\n\nSo if the railway administration wants to be reliable and secure for the customer then the equipment should always have to be in top condition. Regular maintenance is an essential part, for achieving this objective.However, maintenance is costly & it is also inevitable.And more importantly  if maintenance is not done regularly then it can result in fatal consequences, such as unexpected breakdown, delayed trip, it can even jeopardize several lives, and cost a lot of money. And we all  know that a negative impact can dilute the brand image.As a professional practice, one should emphasize maintenance rather than repair, especially in the railway industry. In simple words, to keep your equipment in good working condition, routine maintenance should be done on assets and equipment for their smooth functionality.";
